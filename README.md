# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## 📝 Description
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. The game is designed for two players, Player 1 and Player 2, who alternately mark spaces in a 3x3 grid with 'X' and 'O', respectively. The objective is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).

## 🚀 How to Run
To compile and run the Tic-Tac-Toe game:
1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory** containing the source code:
   ```bash
   cd <directory_name>
   ```
3. **Compile the code** using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.cpp
   ```
4. **Run the compiled program**:
   ```bash
   ./tic_tac_toe
   ```

## 🕹️ How to Play
- The game begins with Player 1, who marks the grid with 'X'.
- Player 2 then marks the grid with 'O'.
- Players take turns to input their choice of position by entering the corresponding letter (a-i) of the grid.
- The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- If all positions are filled without a winner, the game is declared a draw.

## 💡 Features
- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Real-time updates of the game board.
- Automatic detection of wins and draws.

## 📂 Files
- **tic_tac_toe.cpp**: The main source code file for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- A terminal or command line interface to run the compiled program.
